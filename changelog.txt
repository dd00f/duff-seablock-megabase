1.1.6
	- Fixed a bug where catalyst_amount result items weren't boosted in proportion to the output, 
	  causing catalyst to be impacted by productivity bonuses.
	- Skipped applying a recipe boost to recipes that are hidden. This helps improve mod compatibility
	  with the Wire Shortcut mod that cross-links ingredient tables between 2 recipes, causing ingredients
	  to be incorrectly boosted twice.

1.1.5
	- Disabled recipe boosting on any item that can be built on the ground
	- Removed the minimum of 2 second recipe time before boosting
	- Forced recipe boosting to use a round number to ensure no item fractions are generated

1.1.4
	- Fixed bug with factorio version >= 1.1.70 with some recipes producing non-stackable items.

1.1.3
	- Boost all recipe to a minimum of 2 seconds so that no recipe gets speed limited by ticks.
	- Fixes the productivity beacon bug with catalyst production.

1.1.2
	- Boost Solid Rubber from Liquid Rubber Recipe
	- Boost all void recipe to take 60 seconds to reduce UPS cost of furnace dynamically picking recipes
	- Make the clarifier and flare stack fluid capacity bigger to support the larger voiding recipe above.

1.1.1
	- Boost Ore Sorting recipes

1.1.0
	- Support for Factorio version 1.1
